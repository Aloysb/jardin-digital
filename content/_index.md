Welcome to what they refer to as a 'digital garden' ü™¥
{{< /lead >}}

My name is Alo, short for Aloys.
I work as a software developer, mostly on the front end.

In a former life, I used to spend my time doing acrobatics on my paraglider, skiing and exploring the alps.
But lately, I have been spending more time writing software than flying! 

I use this space to share my thoughts as well as build project in public.

I mostly work with React, but I have in the past worked with most front-end frameworks - except for Angular.

That's why, I'm currently building a budget application (YNAB - clone) with Angular - applying Clean Architecture and DDD principle.

If that sounds interesting to you, follow the journey:
